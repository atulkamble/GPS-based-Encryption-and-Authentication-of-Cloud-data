Location based encryption enhances security by integrating position and time into encryption and decryption processes it is not enough to simply enable or disable decryption based on location and time; these aspects must be inte- grated into the key construction process. Furthermore, keys or files in transit should not reveal anything regarding their locations/times of applicability. After reviewing the objectives of location-based encryptio,To overcome the drawbacks of the existing system we concentrating on the security of the confidential data our proposed system not only checks the authorized log in but also checks the location of the user at the time of log in. Because of this user is not able to download any files from anywhere, he must be in the location which is given at the time of registration. It provides more security than existing one. At the time of registration user fill its information. All the information is store into the database in the encrypted format. To encrypt this data we are using AES algorithm.
